# How to Use
1. Copy the `autoCompletion` folder to your NPP installation folder. (or you can skip it, it's not really that useful or necessary).
2. Open Nodepad++, select `Language` from the menu bar and go to `User Defined Language -> Define your language`
3. Use the Import button to import the `udl/sqf.xml` file.
